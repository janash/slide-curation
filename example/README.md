Example: 3.1_03_class_constructors (coding demo)

This example shows a larger, realistic coding session where AI curation adds a lot:
- Step 2 (compare‑last) kept 23 slides (curated.pdf) with per‑slide reasons.
- Pass 2 (kept review) refined to 14 slides and produced student‑facing captions (significant_v2, curated_v2.pdf).
- Annotated PDF adds those captions beneath images for search and study.

Note: Step 1 images (pages) are omitted here to keep the repo light. See the original folder under slides/week3/3.1_03_class_constructors if you need them.

Files are real copies from slides/week3/3.1_03_class_constructors.
